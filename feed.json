            "content_html": "<p>While building a game engine (especially when using modern graphics APIs like Vulkan or DirectX), you will definitely stumble upon an annoying issue. You have too many operations to perform that are surprisingly unrelated to each other. For example, you need a pass to create shadows, another pass to render objects using the created shadow maps, and a pass to render your UI from ImGui.</p>\n<p>You may say that's not an issue; it's like three different functions, easy. Between these calls, I can just transition images as needed, right? Well, that will work, of course. After all, those are simple three passes. <span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">But, what if I just decided to add another pass, like a post-processing pass, which must be added before the UI? (Of course, we don't want the post-processing to happen on our UI components!). </span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">If you didn't discover the issue yet, It's now you have do a special transition between the render and post processing and another one from post processing to UI. </p>\n<p>And this is where we need to introduce an automated way to seamlessly add passes anywhere and in any order, while letting the system sort them correctly. We simply declare that shadows must be rendered before objects because the object pass depends on the shadow data, and the render graph takes care of the rest.</p>\n<p>On top of that, the system should be able to cull passes that are not actually used. For example, if shadows are disabled in the scene, it makes no sense to generate or even request a shadow map texture. That entire pass should be removed automatically.</p>\n<p>You could, of course, choose to not add the shadow pass at all while building the render graph. However, if every pass has to manually check whether all of its inputs are enabled or valid, you quickly end up with countless conditional checks scattered across the frame code. Render graphs solve this by allowing you to describe dependencies explicitly and let the graph compiler handle ordering and culling for you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In this post, I will be using Vulkan because I stumbled the issue of passes while building a game engine.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">When I started learning about game engines, everyone I told about render graphs told me I didn't need them. That made me want to do it even more, and I don't regret it. That taught me a great feature and made implementing things like tiled culling very easy. I just define things, and most of the hard logic is automatically generated.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But why a <strong>graph</strong>? Let's write a formal definition of the render graph: A render graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node represents a rendering pass, and edges represent resource dependencies between passes.</p>\n<p><br data-start=\"920\" data-end=\"923\">Passes do not perform transitions, allocation, or synchronization themselves. Instead, they describe <em data-start=\"1026\" data-end=\"1052\">what they read and write</em>, and the graph compiler derives execution order, resource lifetimes, and barriers.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/render_graph.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"787\" height=\"203\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/render_graph-xs.png 300w ,https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/render_graph-sm.png 480w ,https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/render_graph-md.png 768w ,https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/render_graph-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>I hope this image make things understandable. If not we are going through it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Squares define passes</li>\n<li>Arrows define direction from Pass A to Pass B</li>\n<li>non connected passes means they have been culled therefore they won't be executed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another question would be why all this complexity? Like won't just a simple tracing would work why graphs,...etc. I didn't understand the answer till I remembered unity render passes structure. </p>\n<p>You see we have two different of passes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Engine passes</strong>: Passes that's essential for engine like gbuffer, shadow, skybox, culling,...etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Game Passes</strong>: Like custom post processing, special work that should be done in a render pass,..etc. \n<ul>\n<li>The thing about game passes they will be always added after engine passes.</li>\n<li>For example, I want to add a post processing for skybox only that means this should happen before lit pass. Therefore, we need also constrain to tell it to be exactly where it should be</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In my implementation of a render graph I decided as I mentioned earlier I will make it support reordering. I felt like that's the right way to do it because in a real game you may have tens of render passes defining them in order may not be always right. The ordering part typically optional.</p>\n<p>Now, Let's head into implementation, I decided to start with class based passes I felt like I love it like this then I made a compatible layer of function passes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let's start with <code>RenderPass.h</code> which is an abstract class all render passes should be based on it:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp\"><code>class RenderPass {\npublic:\n    explicit RenderPass(const std::string &amp;name) : _name(name) {\n    }\n\n    virtual ~RenderPass() = default;\n\n    virtual void Setup(RenderGraphBuilder &amp;builder) = 0;\n\n    virtual void Execute(CommandBuffer&amp; cmd, const RenderContext&amp; context) = 0;\n\n    const std::string &amp;GetName() const { return _name; }\n\n\n    virtual bool HasSideEffect() {\n        return true;\n    }\nprotected:\n    std::string _name;\n};</code></pre>\n<p>Simple two functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Setup</code>: which will define textures (definition and usages)</li>\n<li><code>Execute</code>: which execute needed operations inside the command buffer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s move on to the <strong data-path-to-node=\"2,0\" data-index-in-node=\"22\">Builder</strong>, which is a proxy class for the render graph. Its role is to create and import textures, and most importantly define their valid usage</p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp\"><code>class RenderGraphBuilder {\npublic:\n    [[nodiscard]] RGHandle CreateTexture(const RGTextureDesc &amp;desc) const;\n\n    [[nodiscard]] RGHandle FindTexture(const std::string &amp;name) const;\n    \n    void AddDependency(RGHandle handle, AccessType access);\n    \nprivate:\n    std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;RGHandle, AccessType&gt; &gt; _dependencies;\n    \n};</code></pre>\n<p>It's a simple class with two functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CreateTexture</code>: A function that takes information about a texture like size, type, format, and name and return a handle of this function/</li>\n<li><code>FindTexture</code>: Finds an image that was created by another pass to be used in the current pass/</li>\n<li><code>AddDependency</code>: This function takes the texture that was created or define and define how should it be used for the pass like will it be/</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">I know you may have so many questions, I promise I will try to answer them all but let's continue for now</p>\n<p>Let's define what is <strong>AccesType</strong>. As mentioned above, <strong>AccesType </strong>is a how the texture will be used, I won't define everything of course I will define three types to be used later in our example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp\"><code>enum class AccessType {\n    ShaderRead, // Generic Read (defaults to ReadOnlyOptimal)\n    ColorAttachmentWrite, // Generic Write (defaults to ColorAttachmentWrite)\n    ReadWrite, // Generic ReadWrite (defaults to General)\n\n};</code></pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Now, Let's start the real work. We will start simple a RenderGraph that can re order and cull. </p>\n<p>But first, Something that should be mentioned in my game engine I have a class called <code>ResourceManager</code> which responsible for defining and destroying textures. I won't look into that but keep that in mind because I will assume its defined for me as my render graph build its own textures inside and manage their lifetimes. The handle for resource manager textures called <code>RGResource</code></p>\n<p>Let's start by defining some needed structs:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp\"><code>struct RGHandle {\n        uint32_t id = UINT32_MAX;\n        [[nodiscard]] bool IsValid() const noexcept { return id != UINT32_MAX; }\n};\n\nstruct PassDependency {\n    RGHandle resource;\n    AccessType access; // How the pass uses it (Read, Write, ReadWrite)\n};\n\nstruct CompiledPass {\n    RenderPass *pass;\n    std::vector&lt;vk::ImageMemoryBarrier2&gt; imageBarriers;\n};</code></pre>\n<p>Let's define what are these structs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>RGHandle</code>: this is the handle that will be given to passe that represent. </li>\n<li><code>PassDependency</code>: This is a struct that holds the data from <code>AddDependency</code> function mentioned above.</li>\n<li><code>CompiledPass</code>: A struct holds the render the pass and needed image barriers to be executed before executing the pass itself to make sure images in the correct layout.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, we have everything to start implementing the algorithm. We define a function called <code>Compile </code>that does the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\"><code>def Compile():\n    # 1. DISCOVERY &amp; DEPENDENCY CAPTURE\n    for pass in passes:\n        # Run the developer's Setup function\n        # This fills the 'builder._dependencies' vector with (RGHandle, AccessType)\n        pass.Setup(builder)\n        \n        # NOTE: Transient textures are NOT created here. \n        StoreDescriptions(builder.createdResources)\n        \n        # Record which pass index touches which resource handle\n        RecordResourceTouches(pass.index, builder.dependencies)\n\n    # 2. LIFETIME ANALYSIS\n    for resource in allResources:\n        # Determine 'firstPass' and 'lastPass' where this resource is used\n        # This prevents allocating memory for textures before they are needed\n        resource.firstUse = min(touches[passIndex])\n        resource.lastUse = max(touches[passIndex])\n\n    # 3. BUILD DEPENDENCY GRAPH (Adjacency List)\n    for resource in allResources:\n        # Sort usages by pass index (e.g., if used in Pass 0, then Pass 5, then Pass 10)\n        usages = SortUsagesByPass(resource)\n        \n        for i in range(len(usages)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(usages)):\n                passA, accessA = usages[i]\n                passB, accessB = usages[j]\n\n                # Optimization: If both passes only READ, there is no dependency (RAR is fine)\n                if not accessA.isWrite() and not accessB.isWrite():\n                    continue\n                \n                # Otherwise, Pass B depends on Pass A\n                # Add edge: A -&gt; B and increase B's In-Degree (number of incoming dependencies)\n                AddEdge(passA, passB)\n                InDegree[passB] += 1\n\n    # 4.

If you don't get it, don't worry we will cover each part on its own.</p>\n<h3>1- Setup Passes And Record Their Dependencies</h3>\n<p>We take the passes defined by the user and run their setup functions. This gives us a vector that represents all resources. For each resource, we store a list of passes that use it. Each entry in that list is a pair containing the pass index and the type of access that pass needs.</p>\n<p>This how the function would look like:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp\"><code>void RenderGraph::setupPassesAndRecordDependencies(\n    std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;uint32_t, AccessType&gt; &gt; &gt; &amp;resourceTouchList) {\n    const auto passCount = static_cast&lt;uint32_t&gt;(_passes.size());\n    _passDeps.assign(passCount, {});\n    _explicitEdges.clear();\n    resourceTouchList.assign(0, {});\n\n    for (uint32_t p = 0; p &lt; passCount; ++p) {\n        auto &amp;pass = _passes[p];\n        RenderGraphBuilder builder(this, p);\n        pass-&gt;Setup(builder);\n\n        for (auto &amp;[handle, accessType]: builder._dependencies) {\n            if (!handle.IsValid()) continue;\n            uint32_t rid = handle.id;\n            if (rid &gt;= resourceTouchList.size()) {\n                resourceTouchList.resize(rid + 1);\n            }\n            resourceTouchList[rid].emplace_back(p, accessType);\n            _passDeps[p].push_back({handle, accessType});\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>2- Compute The Life Time of a Resource</h3>\n<p>This step is vital for the way I’ve set things up. When you ask the graph to create a texture, creating it right away is inefficient. That pass might end up being culled, and by waiting, we can facilitate texture reuse (aliasing) throughout the frame.</p>\n<p>So, this step does the following, For each resource we check the touch list that was created from the first step and we figure out when the first time they got used and when the last time</p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp\"><code>void RenderGraph::computeResourceLifetimes(\n    const std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;uint32_t, AccessType&gt; &gt; &gt; &amp;resourceTouchList) {\n    const uint32_t resCount = static_cast&lt;uint32_t&gt;(_resources.size());\n    _resourceFirstUse.assign(resCount, UINT32_MAX);\n    _resourceLastUse.assign(resCount, 0);\n\n    for (uint32_t r = 0; r &lt; resCount; ++r) {\n        if (resourceTouchList[r].empty()) continue;\n        uint32_t first = UINT32_MAX, last = 0;\n        for (auto &amp;pr: resourceTouchList[r]) {\n            first = std::min(first, pr.first);\n            last = std::max(last, pr.first);\n        }\n        _resourceFirstUse[r] = first;\n        _resourceLastUse[r] = last;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>3- Building The Graph</h3>\n<p>In this step we take all these passes and add them to the graph as edges and resources become the connectivity between those edge</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/render_graph-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"787\" height=\"203\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/render_graph-2-xs.png 300w ,https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/render_graph-2-sm.png 480w ,https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/render_graph-2-md.png 768w ,https://alielmorsy.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/render_graph-2-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>This is how the code works and will explain it live :)</p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp\"><code>void RenderGraph::buildAdjacencyGraph(\n    const std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;uint32_t, AccessType&gt;

For each resource, it tracks which pass wrote it to it last (Producer). If any other pass reads this resource, the algorithm marks it as a Reader (Consumer) that depends on the last writer (Producer).</p>\n<p>Some passes must be treated differently or we call them <strong>Root</strong>. Two cases where passes treated as roots:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Has a side effect, its a virtual function defined inside RenderPass. If it returns true, It means this is a necessary pass.</li>\n<li>Writes to an imported image, If  there is pass that's writing to an imported image . For example, you are building a pass to render a second camera to an image rather than for screen. This pass must be treated as a root.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once we identify all our roots, the algorithm works backward using BFS to mark passes this way: If pass <strong>A </strong>is needed, and pass <strong>A</strong> depends on pass <strong>B</strong>, then pass <strong>B</strong> is also needed.</p>\n<p>The return from this function is a vector of bools where each index represent  if a pass is needed or not</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>3- Topologically Sort The Remaining Passes (Kahn’s Algorithm)</h3>\n<p>In this step, we determine the valid execution sequence for all needed passes. This happens to ensure a pass is executed only when all its dependencies are executed already.</p>\n<p>The code for it is kinda simple</p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp\"><code>void RenderGraph::buildTopologicalOrder(const std::vector&lt;bool&gt; &amp;needed,\n                                        const std::vector&lt;std::unordered_set&lt;uint32_t&gt; &gt; &amp;adj,\n                                        std::vector&lt;uint32_t&gt; &amp;indeg) {\n    const uint32_t passCount = static_cast&lt;uint32_t&gt;(_passes.size());\n    std::queue&lt;uint32_t&gt; q;\n    for (uint32_t p = 0; p &lt; passCount; ++p) {\n        if (needed[p] &amp;&amp; indeg[p] == 0) {\n            q.push(p);\n        }\n    }\n\n    _passOrder.clear();\n    while (!q.empty()) {\n        uint32_t u = q.front();\n        q.pop();\n        _passOrder.push_back(u);\n        for (uint32_t v: adj[u]) {\n            if (needed[v]) {\n                indeg[v]--;\n                if (indeg[v] == 0) {\n                    q.push(v);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    size_t neededCount = std::ranges::count(needed, true);\n    ASSERT_EX(_passOrder.size() == neededCount &amp;&amp; \"Cycle detected in passes\");\n}</code></pre>\n<p>We start the loop from leafs (only needed leafs). For each leaf, we basically “peel” it off the graph and add it to the final execution timeline. As we do that, we let any passes that were waiting on this leaf know by decrementing their dependency count. When a pass’s count drops to zero, it means all its inputs are ready at that point, it becomes a new leaf and gets pushed onto the queue.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These are the most important and the hardest steps so far in a render graph. The remaining steps so far is allocating textures and building barriers.
